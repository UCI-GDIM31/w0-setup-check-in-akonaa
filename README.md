# GDIM 31 Fall 2024

This is the first GDIM31 assignment! This is not a test - just a way to make sure your computer setup is working for GitHub and to get some knowledge about your prior experience. There aren't correct answers for this so please do not be concerned about your grade when filling this out honestly!

## Introduction

1. Tell me a little bit about yourself and your interest in games! Be sure to include your preferred name and pronouns, and talk a little bit about what games you like to play, why you’re taking the class, any prior experience you have with game development, and what kind of games you hope to build.

Hi! My name is Adhi (pronouns he/him), and I'm pretty new to gameplaying in general. I've always had friends who gamed so I'm not totally illiterate (and am now working on my game literacy), but I fell in love with the creative side of making games first. I've always loved creative writing and narrative design (I have a background in poetry) and wanted to pursue computer science as well, and eventually it seemed like game design could be a logical intersection of my creative energy and technical skills. In the spring I was on a VGDC pitch project team and showcased at Z3, I got the game studies unit in Humanities Core, and I spent a couple weeks in GDIM 61, and I was honestly enamored by all of it. Something about how we can understand how games are built just lights me up like nothing else. It feels right, and I want to chase that. On the pitch project I was the lead design/writing person on a team of four, and we created a finished product, but I'm pretty blind on the coding side of things, so I'm really hoping to change that in this class. I'm hoping to start playing Hades soon, and I think I want to build games that are really intentional in their design-- where all the elements deliberately reinforce a narrative or particular experience and bring it to life. That's the magic I want to make.

2. Which of the following best describes your major? Please specify if not GDIM.  

    - [ ] Game Design & Interactive Media
    - [ ] Computer Science or related major (CS, CSE, Data Science, Informatics, etc) (please specify)
    - [ ] Art-related major (please specify)
    - [ ] Undecided
    - [ ] Other (please specify)

   Enrolled currently as CS but aiming to switch to GDIM

3. What are you hoping to get out of this class?

I want to break the barrier that's kept me from really engaging with the development side of project work and get comfortable with working in         Unity/programming for games. 
   
5. What, if anything, are you nervous about for this class?

   Even after years of coding classes, coding can be intimidating for me. I just hope I can meet the challenges and learn confidence.

## Prior Experience

The next questions ask about what (if any) prior experience you have. This class assumes students have no prior knowledge, so don’t worry if you have 0 experience programming or with game development! Just write 0 or N/A under the headers. These questions are JUST for us to get an overall picture of the class's experience level so that we can make sure to be meeting you all where you are.

### Development

1. Programming (any languages/ frameworks)
   Java, Python, R, HTML

3. Game development (any engine)
   None

4. Unity
   None

### Programming & Game Development Concepts

For the next questions, a programming or game development concept is presented:

 - If you are NOT familiar with this topic, write N/A.
 - If you ARE familiar with this concept, do your best to define it in your own words.

**These questions are not graded for accuracy! Answer honestly, don’t Google it.**

1. Game design document

   Outlines a game's design in terms of features, mechanics, and worldbuilding: basically an articulated blueprint for the game that explains its different     aspects and how they're being developed

2. Scope management

   Keeping work on timeline and within scale

4. Iteration

   Testing and making changes 

6. Object-Oriented programming

    N/A

7. Model-View-Controller architecture

   N/A
